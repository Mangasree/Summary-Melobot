ðŸŽ§ MELOBOT: Design of a chatbot based music recommendation system. ðŸŽ§


ðŸš€Overview ðŸš€

Melobot is a chatbot designed to provide personalized music recommendations based on users' moods, emotions, and specific life situations. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and integrating with the Spotify API, Melobot delivers curated playlists tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the user experience in discovering new music.


ðŸš€Key Features ðŸš€

Mood-Based Recommendations: Users can input their current mood or emotional state, such as "feeling happy," "need motivation," or "just broke up." Melobot processes this information to suggest songs that resonate with their feelings.

Language Preferences: Melobot allows users to specify their preferred language for song recommendations, offering a more personalized experience by curating tracks in languages like English, Telugu, Spanish, and more.

Contextual Situations: The chatbot can handle specific scenarios, such as "songs for a road trip" or "chill music for studying," providing users with the right soundtrack for various life moments.

Real-Time Analysis: Utilizing NLP libraries like spaCy and TextBlob, Melobot analyzes user inputs in real time, understanding context and sentiment to deliver appropriate song recommendations.

Seamless Spotify Integration: By connecting with the Spotify API, Melobot retrieves and plays songs directly from the Spotify platform, allowing users to listen to their recommended tracks instantly.


ðŸš€How It Works ðŸš€

User Input: The user initiates a conversation with Melobot by stating their mood or situation. For example, they might say, "I'm feeling adventurous," or "I need some uplifting music."

Natural Language Processing: Melobot employs NLP techniques to process and analyze the userâ€™s input. It identifies keywords and sentiments to understand the context of the request.

Song Recommendation: Based on the analysis, Melobot queries the Spotify API to fetch suitable songs that match the userâ€™s mood, language, and scenario.

Playlist Generation: The chatbot compiles a playlist of songs and presents them to the user in a user-friendly format, allowing for easy listening.

Continuous Interaction: Users can continue to interact with Melobot, refining their requests or exploring different genres and moods, enhancing the overall music discovery experience.

Tips for Using Melobot Effectively

1. Be Specific with Song Names: If youâ€™re not getting the correct output for a song name, try using the song name along with the artistâ€™s name for better results.

2. Reframe for Clarity: If you don't receive suitable songs for a particular situation, try reframing your sentence using simpler words to help Melobot understand your request better.

3. Use Descriptive Keywords: Incorporate key words like "happy," "depressed," "excited," "romantic," "love," "break up," "wedding," "festive," etc., to enhance the accuracy of the song recommendations.
